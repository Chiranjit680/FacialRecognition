🧠 Facial Recognition using Siamese Neural Networks (One-shot Learning)
This project implements a facial recognition system using Siamese Neural Networks for one-shot image recognition, inspired by the paper:
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf

🧰 Features
📷 Capture anchor and positive images locally using OpenCV
🗂 Uses LFW dataset as negative samples
🧠 Implements a Siamese Neural Network using PyTorch
🔍 One-shot learning with contrastive loss
📊 Evaluation via similarity threshold
